=== Core module

IMPORTANT: depends on `viz-data`

This module contains the main elements to describe the data model extracted from the scenario log files.

NOTE: At the moment, the module contains the log file parsers
but these shall ultimately be moved to the `mas_models` repository, in the `atclib`, more precisely.

==== Input handled

Please refer to the `viz-data` for the description of the files handled.


==== Module architecture

===== DataModelInput class

*Locking the data inputs*




===== DataModel class

==== Custom Logger

This module contains a simple console displaying log messages and export the log in the clipboard.
The corresponding class id `FXLogger` and provides a sub set of the logging methods from the `java.util.logging.Logger` class.
The custom logger also logs in the Java one.

This logger is by default embedded in the traffic visualization HMI (in `viz-traffic-fx`).
