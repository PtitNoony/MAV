=== JavaFX sbt plugin
. Clone the `sbt-javafx` plugin from GitHub @ https://github.com/kavedaa/sbt-javafx[sbt-javafx]
. Open the project in one of your IDEs,
. Modify the `build.sbt` file so it looks like [1],

== Installation

=== In Eclipse

run `sbt eclipse` from the command line in the *mas-model-code* folder

WARNING: Building the project from scratch appears not to work properly with Eclipse.
Consider building the modules in the following order: `data`, `atcLib`, `atm-concepts`, `brahms`, `hmi`, `sim-conf`
